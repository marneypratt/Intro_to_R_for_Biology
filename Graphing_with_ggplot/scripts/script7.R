# This code will give a histogram of the diameters of hemlock trees split by size class

# Note that there was one larger tree as McLeish (MCL) that was 73 cm in diameter.

# We set the max for the x-axis to 45 here using coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,45)) 
# to be able to see the majority of the data better.

# You don't need to make any changes to this script.

# When you are done looking at the code, save this script and type submit() in the console
