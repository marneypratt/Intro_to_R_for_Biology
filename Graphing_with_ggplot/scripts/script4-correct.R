# The dataset we are using is still hemlocks.h, and the variables you are graphing are still x=diameter and y=height 

# This time we want to use location instead of size.group for the color (make the change below)

# By adding size = 3 in the geom_point() function we made the points a little larger

# We also added a geom_smooth() function to add linear regression lines

# The only changes you need to make are to the statements regarding color from size.group to location
# change the color in aes() and labs() (capitalize Location in the legend label)

# When you are done making changes, save this script and type submit() in the console
