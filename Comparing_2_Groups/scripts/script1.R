#Note that everything after hashtags is ignored by R and present as a comment

#Below is a script that will take the hemlocks dataset then will summarize the following
#mean, standard deviation (=sd), median, interquartile range (IQR), and number of observations (=n)

#the structure of the argument in the summarize() function is that you give the output a name 
#then you say what function gives the output (mean(), median() etc) and put the variable of interest
#within the parentheses 

#the print code at the bottom is there so that the code in this script will be run in the console

#You don't need to change anything for this code, so just type submit() in the console
